*"The National New Energy Development centre will help create new business and jobs in Taranaki while helping New Zealand move towards clean, affordable, renewable energy and away from fossil fuels," *

*The Budget will also commit $20 million over four years to establish a new science research fund "for cutting edge energy technology so that we can look into the likes of organic photovoltaics, superconductors, nanotechnologies and inductive power," Ardern said.*

*While wave-generated electricity technology is currently very expensive, New Zealand may become a centre for investigating the engineering and physics challenges posed by harnessing the energy in the ocean in the longer term.*
