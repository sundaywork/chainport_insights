Chainport Labs and the leading urban designer Portal Studio have exchanged their visions and mutual interests in shaping the future of a sustainable building and community. This includes the adapting of innovative building materials, creating energy intelligent building designs, reforming the ways of power transforming and transmission, integrating clustered energy storage systems, etc.

Both parties will be engaged in the accelerating of the Direct Current Microgrid Association which aims to promote powering the building with direct current (DC) so it can save unnecessary energy loss by converting from AC to DC.

[Portal Studio](https://www.portalstudio.co.nz/) provides professional urban design and architectural design across Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam and other countries.
